4. Accounting for course artifacts as intangible assets
References 1.1.-1.2. - all pages involved in educational projects are intangible assets with a special life cycle.

Accordingly, for correct accounting, the Accounting Department must receive data on the costs of developing the NMC (which subsequently form the OS and are put into operation). As soon as a project for a course is created on the basis of the existing, or on the newly developed curriculum, DAILY COURSE MANAGER automatically sends the accounting system the data necessary for the formation of correct postings. And it produces throughout the entire life cycle. As a result, all expenses and future revenues in relation to the provision of educational services are accounted for transparently.
